            The fourth section is the navigation bar right below the search bar. This bar
            contains a
            link on the far left that allows users to log on to E-Pustakalaya with their registered
            usernames. On the right, there is a link called “home page” that redirects users to the
            home
            page. Next to this is a link titled 'feedback' which takes users to the feedback form.
            On the

              sub-sections for
              that section. For example, if you want to see what is available under Nepali
              children's
              literature, first click on the “Sahiyta” section. In the page that shows up, you
              will see a
              number of subsections, one of which is “Nepali Baal Sahiya”. Now clicking on the
              “Nepali Baal
              Sahiya” link will display all the materials in that sub-section. The displayed list
              will
              include the title and author of each item in the collection. This list is analogous

              to
              the pdf file displayed under “ Click here to Read/Download”.

              Depending on your browser configuration, the link will ask you to either
              save/open the file
              or automatically open the file in a new browser window.In case you choose to save
              the file, then
              you will have to go into the folder where you have saved it, and click on the file
              within that
              folder which will open the book with a PDF reading software (such as Adobe Reader
              for PCs). In
              case you choose to open the file directly, then you can save it onto your computer
              after it has
              been opened.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>At any point while the user is browsing through E-Pustakalaya, if she wants to go to
              any of the seven main sections, she can do so directly by simply clicking on the
              links for these
              sections on the categories bar right above the content area.
