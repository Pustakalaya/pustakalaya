                    improve children's reading skills and develop a reading culture in schools by giving them free and
                    open access to age-appropriate reading materials and to enable students to do research projects and

                    other adults have also benefited widely from various teaching resources, and educational materials
                    in agriculture, health, environment, local technologies, and so on.
